# button bypass for a certain driving school website in the Philippines 
*hint: roads that are not in danger*
Tampermonkey script that bypasses the weird logic implemented on the website where you have to wait for 20 seconds before going to the next question. WHY DO I NEED TO WAIT FOR 20 SECONDS IF I KNOW IT ALREADY!!!

How to use:
1. download tampermonkey
2. add this script to tampermonkey
3. enable ONLY when taking a quiz, or don't 🤷‍♂️
4. if using brave disable shield for that website
5. button would enable on user mouse click even before the 40 second mark
